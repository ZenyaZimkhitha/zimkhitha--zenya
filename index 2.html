    <p><article>Immunisations aren’t currently required or even recommended for those visiting South Africa’s major cities and coastal resort areas (although some doctors recommend you to check that your polio and tetanus jabs are up-to-date), unless you’ve come from an area where yellow fever is endemic (for example, Kenya, Tanzania and the northern half of South America), in which case you need to carry documentary proof that you’ve been vaccinated. This situation, however, could change and you’re recommended to consult your doctor at least six weeks before travelling to the country to check the current situation.</article></p>

  <h2>OUR AIM</h2>
  <h3>EASY-AID APP</h3>
  <p><article>One of the most important aspects of living in South Africa (or anywhere for that matter) is maintaining good health.Although South Africa has what medical authorities regard as one of the healthiest climates in the world, a tradition of playing sports and enjoying an active, outdoor lifestyle, access to plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, and some of the planet’s cleanest air, its people aren’t as healthy as might be imagined.South Africa’s major public health concerns are HIV/AIDS, smoking-related diseases and tuberculosis, all of which affect the non-white population more than the white. Apart from that, the country is relatively free of major health problems, which is a surprise to some people, given Africa’s reputation as a continent riven by diseases and other health hazards.</article></p>

    <h2>HEALTHCARE DILEMMA IN SA</h2>
      <h3>24 HOUR EMERGENCY</h3>
       <p>In most developed countries patients with  life-threatening illnesses are given their treatment  within the certain allotted time. Usually a Category "A" patient will wait around 8minutes for paramedics to arrive on the scene in about 79% of the time. A Category "B" patient or a non life-threatening situation could take up to 19minutes around 98% of the time.Still a Department of Health spokesman in one European country said this:"We often see an increase in demand for ambulances during the winter season and this year is no different.Our Health Service is coping well with this increased demand. We have done a lot of work in recent years across the country to share the best practice. Our staff are working hard and doing great work to respond to the extra demand. South Africa,a NIC country,had its health system modernise in the year 2000,yet rural area health care is getting worse, not better, with each and every passing day. Currently our infant mortality rate is 6 times higher than in the OECD countries. About 5.5 million South Africans have HIV/AIDS or 10.6% of South Africa's total population with 17% of the adult population that lives with this dreadful illness. Most of them live in rural South Africa. Death rates from these are extremely high. But what else adds to such a burden?</p>
